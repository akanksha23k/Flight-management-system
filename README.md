✈️ Flight Management System (Java Console Application with Lambdas & Streams)
Description

The Flight Management System is a Java-based console application designed to efficiently manage flight-related data and operations. This system allows users to add, remove, filter, sort, and print flights based on different criteria such as price, ratings, or destinations.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and modern Java features like Lambdas and Streams, making it a practical example of how functional programming can simplify data processing and sorting tasks.
